\section{Executive Summary}
Our product provides a new and effective way for in-store shoppers to navigate smoothly through any storefront. A mobile application with a streamlined and effective indoor navigation system that guides users through stores, allowing large shopping lists to be completed in quicker, more comfortable ways for the user. 

For customers, i.e large retail stores, we provide valuable data on user activity within the stores, allowing them to evaluate under/over-utilized areas of their locations while enabling effective advertisement of select products based on shopper data and interests. 

Our team, containing experienced algorithm developers and with previous experience in the retail industry, are suited to create a product that understands both what stores and store-goers are wanting for in the current system.

\section{Management team}
Our team consists of six computer science students who attend Lund University. We are currently in our third year of our studies and have learned a great deal about software and programming. Even though we study together, the members of the team have varying experiences that are relevant for this project.

The members are: Thomas Dellwik, Marina Fridh-Cardoso, Nicolas Jaua Otero, Viktor Jernberg, Erik Nicander and Nils Reberg. The different relevant experiences that the members have will help with early development and serves as a great base for us to get started. For example: Nicolas has previously worked with startups and has designed apps, Erik is great at design concepts and has done graphic design, and Viktor has worked a management role at a grocery store which is relevant because grocery stores are the target customer.

The main concern about competence missing from the team  is legal education and possibly leadership experience. If we could have a person with legal knowledge in our team, our team would essentially be complete as a startup.
