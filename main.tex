\section{Executive Summary}
The retail shopping experience is at the heart of modern commerce, with over 80\% of sales in the largest European countries being done in-store.\cite{statista1}

However, navigating large storefronts effectively is often a challenging task, especially for larger shopping lists or unfamiliar store layouts.

Providing solutions for effective, streamlined in-store shopping is a crucial task, not only for shopper satisfaction but also for increasing sales and efficiency for the store owner.

Currently, the solutions for in-store navigations face several issues. Static maps do not provide real-time tracking and as such depend on the users ability to read maps, while existing digital navigation solutions are either store-specific or lacking in functionality.

Additionally, retailers struggle to use detailed customer data to optimize store design or target ads appropriately, missed opportunities to improve customer experience and performance These gaps underscore the urgent need for new in-store and customer engagement strategies.

To address this, our team presents a mobile application with a streamlined and effective indoor navigation system, enabling shoppers to effortlessly complete their shopping lists, regardless of its size or the shoppers familiarity of a specific store.

For retailers, we offer crucially valuable insights into the behavior of their visitiors, allowing them to accurately and empirically indetify under- and overutilized areas of their stores, 
while at the same time reducing the amount of man hours needed for retail workers assisting shoppers in navigating the store.


Our team, containing experienced algorithm developers and with previous experience in the retail industry, are suited to create a product that understands both what stores and store-goers are wanting for in the current system.

\section{Management team}
Our team consists of six computer science students who attend Lund University. We are currently in our third year of our studies and have learned a great deal about software and programming. Even though we study together, the members of the team have varying experiences that are relevant for this project.

The members are: Thomas Dellwik, Marina Fridh-Cardoso, Nicolas Jaua Otero, Viktor Jernberg, Erik Nicander and Nils Reberg. The different relevant experiences that the members have will help with early development and serves as a great base for us to get started. For example: Nicolas has previously worked with startups and has designed apps, Erik is great at design concepts and has done graphic design, and Viktor has worked a management role at a grocery store which is relevant because grocery stores are the target customer.

The main concern about competence missing from the team  is legal education and possibly leadership experience. If we could have a person with legal knowledge in our team, our team would essentially be complete as a startup.

\section{Business Model}
The main customer segment of our product are retail and grocery stores, and the contingent of shoppers who appreciate assistance, 
guidance or finding deals using cloud services. 
\subsection{MOM Test and Prototyping}
Using the MOM test, our team assessed potential users experiences with in-store retail shopping. Subjects were asked the following questions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item How would you describe your in-store shopping habits?
    \item Do you regularly have issues navigating stores?
    \item How do you typically address these issues?
    \item Do you typically ask retail employees questions about item locations or current deals?
    \item Are there certain types of stores you avoid?
    \item What could persuade you to start shopping at these stores?
    \item Is it important for you to save time while shopping?
\end{enumerate}
Our small-scale research found that a majority of the people we asked were interested in cutting down the time it takes for them to shop, especially in grocery stores. 

Additionally, many expressed frustration in regularly having issues finding certain items. Frustration was also described in not reliably being able to ask in-store personnel questions, either due to social barriers or more commonly due to lack of available personnel. 

These answers suggest that our company has a good product-market fit, which was further explored using prototyping.

Prototyping was done using a general description of the product alongside mockup images, see Figure \ref{fig:mockups}.
This prototyping provided further insights, as potential users were allowed to visualise the product and results were largely positive. Valuable feedback in requests for functionality and accessibility provided our team with structure for implementing a final product.

\end{figure}

Unlike current solutions, which give minimal or no information to the consumer on where to go for various items,
our solution aims to instead give the consumer the ability to find items with a mobile solution,
letting them obtain information of product positions without having to actively seek them out.
In addition, the staff requirement of providing information to store customers would be greatly relaxed.

Usage and improvement of our product are tightly interconnected, as by user data such as store customer positions over time 
and user-provided map complementary data, our product improves. 
Unlike other solutions, our model can also combine the data from different model consumers, 
facilitating a high potential for growth.

By initially releasing our product for a lower price than a projected market price for a similar solution,
a market position as a leader in the product space would be obtained.
After obtaining a larger market share, a revenue stream by advertisements, 
licensing fees and selling the user data would be lucrative.

\section{Market Analysis}
Our product would be aimed at in-store shoppers, people who want help getting around different stores and getting the best possible deals for what they are searching for. There are multiple current alternatives that cover part of what we aim for. For example, many supermarket stores have their own apps that show weekly deals, searching for products, among other things. Other apps like Tiendeo offer the possibility of seeing the catalog of discounts in nearby stores in your area. And the stores themselves usually display their own discounts and offer physical catalogs with their offers. 

Though this helps when searching for deals, it does not help customers find their way within the store, where they would rely on looking around, checking the signs or asking for help from the store personnel. Pointr offers the possibility of indoor positioning, but it has not reached the Swedish market, and it is limited to countries like the US and the UK. 

We present a unique opportunity for companies that partner with us to collect data on in-store customer behaviour, especially when privacy laws are increasingly restrictive on what data companies can collect. By using the shopping list and the route that the customer takes throughout the store, we can track what items customers buy beyond what they initially intend to. This can help the stores improve their in-store marketing and figure out what gets the customer to stop in their tracks and spontaneously purchase an item.

From the purely technical perspective, our startup has the competency to develop an initial working prototype or something resembling a finished product. The main worries would be maintaining a larger operation and managing the legal side of the startup since we are a small team of computer science students.

Our product has the ability to combinine the side of navigation within the store, optimizing routes according to items or shopping lists, plus promoting the user with deals and offering the option to compare product prices in different stores from the comfort of a single app.

For our initial market we would aim to partner with some individual stores in limited locations to show both users and customers, like supermarket chains, the possibilities our app offers. We would start with a smaller city, like Lund, and promote the app in front of the stores we would be partnered with. We would aim our product mainly at bigger families, who want to optimize the time they spend in stores and the amount of money they spend on products.

\section{Implementation plan}

\section{Risk assessment}

A risk assessment of the entirety of this project concludes that significant risks stem from two sources: lack in interest from users and businesses, and risks associated with the inexperience of the team.

A failure to attract enough attention from and involvement of users in our product would make it significantly more difficult to attract investors as well as attract advertising companies, therefore directly affecting our main stream of revenue. Lacking interest from businesses will also make it difficult expand the usability of our product, in turn making it less desirable for users.

In order to mitigate these risks, MOM-tests and prototyping will help the team ensure that there is a market for the product, and that the problem-solution fit is good. Exclusive offers for partner businesses and users at the initial stages may help attract more of both categories. Prototyping at different stages in development, both for user side application and business side maintenance, to further solidify the solution is a good fit will help create a successful product. Offering help with setup and integration into existing warehouse management systems can help ease businesses who are concerned with the amount of work required, for set-up and maintenance alike. 

Inexperience in the team give rise to risks involving poor or insufficient planning, and an unrealistic schedule and budget. The plan may lack in granularity in turn leading to inaccurate estimates. Some important tasks may be overlooked or forgotten, or things may be planned out in a suboptimal way. Resources may be wrongly distributed causing a delay in some part of the project while an other part is stalled waiting for the delayed part.

By carefully applying well tested and known methods in creating a system anatomy and implementation plan, we hope to mitigate some of the risk. Methods like planning poker to estimate effort on different activities, and trying to give a little more slack than believed necessary some extra room for error should be created. Regular check-ins with the team to see the progress will allow potential problems to be discovered earlier so that action may be taken to minimize consequences. If possible a mentor or a review by someone with more experience in software related business could also be helpful when finalizing the implementation plan.

A complete risk assessment can be found in the appendix \ref{risktable}.
