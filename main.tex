Our product provides a new and effective way for in-store shoppers to navigate smoothly through any storefront. A mobile application with a streamlined and effective indoor navigation system that guides users through stores, allowing large shopping lists to be completed in quicker, more comfortable ways for the user. 

For customers, i.e large retail stores, we provide valuable data on user activity within the stores, allowing them to evaluate under/over-utilized areas of their locations while enabling effective advertisement of select products based on shopper data and interests. 

Our team, containing experienced algorithm developers and with previous experience in the retail industry, are suited to create a product that understands both what stores and store-goers are wanting for in the current system.
